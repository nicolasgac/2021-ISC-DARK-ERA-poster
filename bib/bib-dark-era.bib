  abstract = {For low-frequency radio astronomy, software correlation and beamforming on general purpose hardware is a viable alternative to custom designed hardware. LOFAR, a new-generation radio telescope centered in the Netherlands with international stations in Germany, France, Ireland, Poland, Sweden and the UK, has successfully used software real-time processors based on IBM Blue Gene technology since 2004. Since then, developments in technology have allowed us to build a system based on commercial off-the-shelf components that combines the same capabilities with lower operational cost. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a GPU-based correlator and beamformer with the same capabilities as the Blue Gene based systems. We focus on the design approach taken, and show the challenges faced in selecting an appropriate system. The design, implementation and verification of the software system show the value of a modern test-driven development approach. Operational experience, based on three years of operations, demonstrates that a general purpose system is a good alternative to the previous supercomputer-based system or custom-designed hardware.}

The Interface-Based {SDF} ({IBSDF}) model extends the semantics of the {SDF} model by introducing a graph composition mechanism based on hierarchical interfaces. Computing the throughput of an application is essential when designing {DSP} systems. This article introduces and assesses new methods to compute the throughput of {DSP} applications specified with {IBSDF} graphs. First, a basic method inspired from the state-of-the-art techniques that relies on a transformation of the {IBSDF} graph to an equivalent non-hierarchical graph of potentially exponential size. Second, a new technique that takes advantage of the hierarchy semantics of the {IBSDF} {MoC} to speed-up the throughput evaluation without any conversion. The proposed technique makes it possible to compute the throughput of large {IBSDF} graphs in a few milliseconds, where the basic method fails to produce a result.},

  abstract     = {The measurement of polarized radiation uses entirely diﬀerent methods at optical and radio wavelengths. As a result, the algebraic analysis of polarimeter performance diﬀers and, in the case of radio interferometry, is unnecessarily complicated. We demonstrate that the mathematical operation of outer matrix multiplication provides the missing link between the two approaches. Within one coherent framework, we then unite the concepts of Stokes parameters and Wolf coherency matrix, the Jones and Mueller calculi from optics, and the techniques of radio interferometry based on multiplying correlators. We relate the polarization performance of a complete radio interferometer to the (matrix) polarization properties of its successive signal processing stages, providing a clear view of how a radio polarimeter works. Our treatment also clariﬁes the nature of and the relations between the various types of transformations used in optical polarimetry. We develop the analysis from the radio interferometrist’s point of view, but include enough background for a wider audience. In a companion paper, we discuss in more detail the application to the calibration of radio interferometer systems; in a third paper we investigate the {IAU} (1973) radio deﬁnition of the Stokes parameters and its precise translation into mathematical form.},

Dataflow Models of Computation ({MoCs}) are increasingly used for developing parallel applications as their high-level of abstraction eases the automation of mapping, task scheduling and memory allocation onto {MPSoCs}. This paper introduces a technique for deploying hierarchical dataflow graphs efficiently onto {MPSoC}. The proposed technique exploits different granularity of dataflow parallelism to generate both {NoC}-based communications and nested {OpenMP} loops. Deployment of an image processing application on a many-core {MPSoC} results in speedups of up to 58.7 compared to the sequential execution.},

  url        = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00877643/document},
  abstract   = {Currently, Multicore Digital Signal Processor ({DSP}) platforms are commonly used in telecommunications baseband processing. In the next few years, high performance {DSPs} are likely to combine many more {DSP} cores for signal processing with some General-Purpose Processor ({GPP}) cores for application control. As the number of cores increases in new {DSP} platform designs, scheduling of applications is becoming a complex operation. Meanwhile, the variability of the scheduled applications also tends to increase as applications become more sophisticated. Such variations require runtime adaptivity of application scheduling. This paper extends the previous work on adaptive scheduling by using the Hybrid Flow-Shop ({HFS}) scheduling method, which enables the device architecture to be modeled as a pipeline of Processing Elements ({PEs}) with multiple alternate {PEs} for each pipeline stage. {HFS} scheduling is applied to the scheduling of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution ({LTE}) telecommunication standard Uplink Physical Layer data processing ({PUSCH}). The experiments, conducted on an {ARM} Cortex-A9 {GPP}, show that an {HFS} scheduling algorithm has an overhead that increases very slowly with the number of {PEs}. This makes the method suitable for executing the adaptive scheduling in less than 1 ms for the 501 actors of a {LTE} {PUSCH} dataflow description executed on a 256-core architecture.},

  abstract   = {Modern embedded systems tend to consist of multiple processors like multicore {DSP} (Digital Signal Processor) or {MPSoC} (Multiprocessor System-on-Chip). Static task scheduling for rapid prototyping of parallel embedded systems is different from the dynamic monocore scheduling problem. The communication between cores has a very high impact on the scheduling and the resulting use of hardware resources. Taking into account communication costs and competition can increase excessively the time spent in the prototyping. The System-Level Architecture Model proposed in this paper aims to provide simple system-level descriptions of architectures. The model is expressive enough to enable simulation of modern architecture behaviors. It also reduces the complexity of static mapping-scheduling by precalculating routes between elements.},
